# Hashmark AI

**Hashmark AI** is an AI-powered document notary built on the Hedera network.  
It lets anyone upload a file, pay per notarization in HBAR, and get a permanent, verifiable proof of existence.  
Each notarization is summarized by AI, recorded to Hedera File Service (HFS), and minted as a 1-of-1 NFT on Hedera Token Service (HTS).  
All notarizations and agent-generated attestations stream in real time over Hedera Consensus Service (HCS).

Built for the **Hello Future: Origins** hackathon (Track: AI & Agents)

## ‚ú® Features

- **Pay-per-use notarization** in HBAR via MetaMask on Hedera testnet
- **Local file hashing** (SHA-256) before upload
- **AI-generated summary** for each document (OpenAI API)
- **Immutable proof**: metadata stored on HFS with no update keys
- **On-chain NFT marker**: 1-of-1 HTS token per notarization
- **Live HCS feed**: notarizations + attestations appear in real time
- **Automated agent attestations**: subscriber reacts to new HCS events, runs checks, signs results, and stores them back to HFS
- **Duplicate detection**: skips payment if the file was already notarized
- **Verification tool**: upload any file to check for a match and view its proofs

## How It Works

1. **Upload a file** (PDF, DOCX, or image).
2. Client hashes the file locally and checks with the server if it‚Äôs already in the registry.
3. If new, MetaMask prompts for an HBAR payment to the treasury address.
4. Server verifies the payment on-chain, re-hashes the uploaded file, and generates an AI summary + deterministic field extraction.
5. Metadata (hash, filename, summary, extracted fields, timestamp) is stored immutably in HFS.
6. A 1-of-1 HTS NFT is minted with metadata pointing to the HFS file.
7. Server publishes a `hedger.notarized` event to HCS.
8. Agent subscriber picks up the event, runs extra checks, signs an attestation, stores it to HFS, and publishes a `hedger.attested` event.
9. Both notarizations and attestations stream live to the frontend.
10. Anyone can verify a file by re-hashing and looking up its records.

## üß™ Testing Instructions (+Local Development)

### Option 1 ‚Äì Test on Live Deployment
1. Visit: https://hashmark-ai.onrender.com
2. Connect MetaMask to Hedera Testnet (chainId 0x128).
3. Use Testnet HBAR from https://portal.hedera.com/faucet
4. **Notarization Test**: Upload any file under ‚ÄúNotarize‚Äù and approve the HBAR payment.
5. **Verification Test**: Switch to the ‚ÄúVerify‚Äù tab, re-upload the same file, confirm that:
   - File hash matches an existing notarization.
   - Proofs, summaries, and NFT data appear.

### Option 2 ‚Äì Test Locally
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ElfWebTeam/Hashmark-AI.git
   cd Hashmark-AI
   npm install
2. Create a .env file from .env.example (see Environment Variables below).
3. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   npm start
4. Open http://localhost:3000 and repeat the same tests as in Option 1.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ElfWebTeam/Hashmark-AI.git
   cd Hashmark-AI
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   Then open: http://localhost:3000
   Requirements: 
   - Node.js 18+
   - MetaMask wallet connected to Hedera Testnet (chainId 0x128)
   - Testnet HBAR in your wallet

   .env file with:
   HEDERA_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.xxxxxx
   HEDERA_OPERATOR_KEY=302e0201...
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   TREASURY_ADDRESS=0x...
   PRICE_WEI=500000000000000000
   HASHIO_RPC_URL=https://testnet.hashio.io/api
   MAX_FILE_MB=12
   PORT=3000

### Verification Flow
- Go to the Verify section.
- Upload any file.
- The app hashes the file and checks if it matches an existing notarization.
- If matched, shows:
- Original HFS file ID
- HTS token ID
- Any agent-generated attestations (HFS file IDs and timestamps)
