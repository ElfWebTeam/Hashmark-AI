# Hashmark AI

**Hashmark AI** is an AI-powered document notary built on the Hedera network.  
It lets anyone upload a file, pay per notarization in HBAR, and get a permanent, verifiable proof of existence.  
Each notarization is summarized by AI, recorded to Hedera File Service (HFS), and minted as a 1-of-1 NFT on Hedera Token Service (HTS).  
All notarizations and agent-generated attestations stream in real time over Hedera Consensus Service (HCS).

Built for the **Hello Future: Origins** hackathon (Track: AI & Agents)

## âœ¨ Features

- **Pay-per-use notarization** in HBAR via MetaMask on Hedera testnet
- **Local file hashing** (SHA-256) before upload
- **AI-generated summary** for each document (OpenAI API)
- **Immutable proof**: metadata stored on HFS with no update keys
- **On-chain NFT marker**: 1-of-1 HTS token per notarization
- **Live HCS feed**: notarizations + attestations appear in real time
- **Automated agent attestations**: subscriber reacts to new HCS events, runs checks, signs results, and stores them back to HFS
- **Duplicate detection**: skips payment if the file was already notarized
- **Verification tool**: upload any file to check for a match and view its proofs

## How It Works

1. **Upload a file** (PDF, DOCX, or image).
2. Client hashes the file locally and checks with the server if itâ€™s already in the registry.
3. If new, MetaMask prompts for an HBAR payment to the treasury address.
4. Server verifies the payment on-chain, re-hashes the uploaded file, and generates an AI summary + deterministic field extraction.
5. Metadata (hash, filename, summary, extracted fields, timestamp) is stored immutably in HFS.
6. A 1-of-1 HTS NFT is minted with metadata pointing to the HFS file.
7. Server publishes a `hedger.notarized` event to HCS.
8. Agent subscriber picks up the event, runs extra checks, signs an attestation, stores it to HFS, and publishes a `hedger.attested` event.
9. Both notarizations and attestations stream live to the frontend.
10. Anyone can verify a file by re-hashing and looking up its records.

## Local Development

Clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElfWebTeam/Hashmark-AI.git
cd Hashmark-AI
npm install
npm start

Then open: http://localhost:3000

Requirements:

Node.js 18+

MetaMask wallet connected to Hedera Testnet (chainId 0x128)

Testnet HBAR in your wallet

### Verification Flow
-Go to the Verify section.
-Upload any file.
-The app hashes the file and checks if it matches an existing notarization.
-If matched, shows:
-Original HFS file ID
-HTS token ID
-Any agent-generated attestations (HFS file IDs and timestamps)
